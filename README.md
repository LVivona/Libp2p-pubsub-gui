## Reason Behind The Code

This was mainly for learning golang gui, and connecting that gui with a peer from libp2p, it is also well to note that most of the code has been ripped from the examples provided by go-libp2p in which they build a publish/subscription, You can check it out I provide a link in the resource section of the README.
